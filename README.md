HOW TO START THE GAME:
To start playing my game you need to go to: https://github.com/nique0401/Udacity_Arcade_Game_Clone

Save all files and unzip into same folder, open Index.html and you can proceed to set up your game by typing in your name in the provided box.  then choose a difficulty you want to play.  Each difficulty has progressively faster enemies to pass. Once you select a difficulty the game will automatically start!

HOW TO PLAY?
you start the game with 3 lives and 0 points, every time you cross the stones,
and jump into the water, you earn 100 points. But watch out! if a bug catches you
on the way to the water, you lose a life and start at the beginning, and at 0 lives, your game is over!

HOW DO I WIN?
This game is never ending! every time you jump in the water, the bugs multiply!
and the next time you run to the water there will be even more bugs trying to stop
you!  Gain as many points as you can, and try to avoid the ever growing mob of
bugs, to get your High score!

Base files of Engine.js, resources.js and app.js were provided by Udacity at:https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/tree/master/js

Used ideas from Andrew Salcedo to complete some of the engine.js edits needed to create my starting page: https://github.com/andrwsalcdo/udacity-arcade-game
