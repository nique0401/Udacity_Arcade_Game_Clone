# Udacity Arcade Game Clone

A clone of the classic Frogger game, where you will use your character to cross the stone into the water.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To install this project, you will download from the following site:
https://github.com/nique0401/Udacity_Arcade_Game_Clone

After you download the file, you will unzip it into the same folder, and run the Index.html


## How to play:

This is a very simple game in which your end goal is to cross the stone paths, into the water as many times as possible

### How do I move!?

This game is controlled with the arrow keys, it will move you one block in any direction, forward, left, right or backwards.

### How do I earn points?

Every time you cross and jump into the river without being killed, you will earn 100 points! But, the bugs are smart creatures, each time you cross more bugs will spawn!
